**SKILLS & EXPERIENCE SUMMARY**

> Commercial diving is the work I am trained and well suited for. I have been a commercial diver for 15 years. Safety, teamwork and efficient execution of complex tasks comes naturally. I started my career in coastal shipping and inland waters and Civils, and have steadily progressed to offshore construction, inspection, repair and maintenance. During these years I have acquired a wealth of skills and experience from operating a wide variety of machinery, equipment, DDC operations, tools, pneumatic and hydraulic tool, subsea and topside rigging and crane operations. I will contribute to your company great physical stamina, emotional stability, good problem solving, perseverance, determination and cultivated safe practices, plus better myself and be an asset to the company e.g. next step 3.1 Inspection Diver.
